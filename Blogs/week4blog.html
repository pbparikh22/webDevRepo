            <h3 style="text-align: center">Javascript Events</h3>
            <p>Hello! Events are actions you can add to your webpage to make it more fun and exciting. They
            For example, you can add a button that could change the font or size of text. This button would 
            fire a signal when clicked and run the code that is made for it. This code would have to be written
            using javascript and use event handlers to run the event when triggered. If we take a look a at the javascript
            below, we have created a const variable named btn that grabs the button by using the query querySelector. We then
            create a function that generates a random. Finally, we add the action to the button when clicked by 
            using the random() so that it creates a random number when the person clicks on it. I would like to thank
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events">MDN web docs</a>for 
            their help and examples on understanding more about Javascript events. </p>
            <pre>
                const btn = document.querySelector('button');

                function random(number) {
                    return Math.floor(Math.random() * (number+1));
                }

                btn.onclick = function() {
                const rndCol = 'rgb(' + random(255) + ',' + random(255) + ',' + random(255) + ')';
                document.body.style.backgroundColor = rndCol;
                }

            <h3 style="text-align: center">XHTML</h3>
            <p> The X in XHTML is not a typo. It stands for EXtensible Hypertext Markup Language. It also sounds 
            cool, right? XHTML is similar to HTML, but it is stricter and cleaner compared to its counterpart. The 
            benefits of using this is that documents that are written in this can utilize applications such as applets 
            and scripts. It also gives you a well-structred format, so that your webpages can be easily processed in the 
            future by other web browsers. I would like to thank 
            <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/xhtml/what_is_xhtml.htm">tutorialspoint</a> for helping me understanding
            more about XHTML.
