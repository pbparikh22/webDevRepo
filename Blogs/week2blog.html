            <p>Hello! This past week, I learned more about what classes are and the different ways they can be used.
            I honestly, believed that I would not need to review this topic, but after several hours of studying and testing, I've
            found out that I have much to learn. For example, I did not know that Javascript can use class names in order to get an element.
            When I read more into this, I noticed that if if you can get an element by their clas name in Javascript, then you can 
            add eventListeners to your webpages. When I learned about this, it was exciting because now I can manipulate a webpage, by 
            clicking on a button and changing the style of them. If you look at the code below, you will see the Javascript that goes behind this.
            Thanks to my go-to website, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp">GeeksforGeeks</a>, I was able to learn more about JavaScript and HTML. </p>
            <pre>
                function myFunction() {
                    var x = document.getElementsByClassName("city");
                    for (var i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
                      x[i].style.display = "none";
                    }
                  }
                    
            </pre>

            <h3 style="text-align: center">Iframe</h3>
            <p>When I first came upon this strange and yet cool topic, I was intrguied. I originally had no idea what Iframes
            were. However, thanks to <a href="lifewire.com/when-to-use-iframes-3468667">LifeWire</a> I can see why these would 
            be helpful. For example, one would use Iframes to store a browser inside your webpage. This may seem weird at first, 
            but it can be used to play a video or even show a map inside your webpage. One example of Iframes would be playng a Youtube
            video on your website. </p>
