            <h3 style="text-align: center">Parallax Scrolling</h3>
            <p>Hello! This past week, I reasearch about parallax scrolling. This techinique allows the background content
            to move at a differnet speed than the foreground content. Usually, many people that use this, tend to impelement 
            an image into the background of the webpage. However, you can also make the image in background move with your mouse
            as well. However, this would require a bit more work and javascript code. Consequently, we will just keep our explanation 
            simple and straightforward. If you look over the html code below, you will see that we have set the background-sizeto 
            fix and have also centered the image on the webpage. Consequently, this will allow the image to stay at a certain 
            place while the user keeps on scrolling. This code snippet as well as my understanding of parallax scrolling came from
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_parallax.asp">w3schools</a>.</p>
            <pre>
                background-attachment: fixed;
                background-position: center;
                background-repeat: no-repeat;
                background-size: cover;
                    
            </pre>

            <h3 style="text-align: center">Responsive Images</h3>
            <p>When people use their phones to view images, the size of them would have to be adjusted in order to show a clear
            picture. It is very important for the image to not dissappear or be misconfigured when viewing on different devices.
            Consequently, HTML provides a way to solve this problem very easily by having responsive images. By adjusting the width
            to 100% and the height to auto, a person can view an image on any device with ease. Sounds pretty neat, right?? If we 
            look at the image, you will see an example of an image with this implentation. I would like to thank 
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images">MDN web docs</a> for 
            their assistance on creating responsive images.  </p>
