            <p> Hello! This will be the last blog for CS347. In this blog, we will discuss improvements that could help future
                students who take this course. The way this class was structured, I would not change much. However, I do have
                one idea for adjusting this class that could help other students. First of all, I would change the course 
                so that we could spend more time on learning about express, Node.js, and Redux. I believe these topics are very important in 
                web development and by spending some time by actually learning and applying these things to what we do could better our 
                understanding of them. Not to mention, it could also help with the projects we create as well. After we finished learning about
                static websites, we immediately jumped into learning about React and Node.js. At first, everythng seemed fine because we were 
                learning about the fundamentals and were also able to keep up with the videos provided by the professor. However, once we started creating
                our own apps for the labs, things seemed to go sideways (at least for me) because I did not fully understand how it all worked.
                Which is why, if we spent a little bit more time applying our knowledge and skills to these topics and not only rely on the labs, I believe 
                we could better equip ourselves for the projects and even create own apps without the assistance of the professor. I would like to thank
                the <a href="https://twodee.org/blog/">twodee</a> website for helping me come up with ideas on how to adjust the course.

            <p> When I came into this course, I had a limited understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript. As the course progressed, 
                I learned so many new topics that I have never known about. In order to keep up with the new material, the videos the professor
                posted every week greatly helped my understanding on these new topics, especially on react. The professor clearly stated 
                what he was doing in the videos and showed his execution of the code. Since I learn better when I see the execution of something, 
                the videos helped a lot in my learning. The code below was part of the very first react app we made in class by following what the 
                professor was doing in his video. This code represents a constant variable named addColor located in the App function we created when we
                first started learning about react. Another way I learned the material was through executing the labs during class time. These 
                labs were challenging, but they also reinforced the concepts related to what we were learning about. They also provided a way for students
                to collaborate with one another and think critically about the solutions. Since most of us were new to many topics discussed, we all 
                strggled a bit on coming up with solutions. However, these labs allowed us to think beyond what we reviewed in the videos and actually 
                think critically for new answers. As a result, by paying attention to the videos and participating in the labs, I believe other students will
                be able to succeed in this class. I would like to thank the <a href="https://twodee.org/blog/">twodee</a> website for helping me come up with ideas 
                what material helped through this course.

                const addColor = newColor => {
                    setColors(colors => [newColor, ...colors.filter(color => 
                      color.name !== newColor.name)]);
                  }
