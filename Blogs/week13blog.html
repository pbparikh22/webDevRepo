            <h3 style="text-align: center"> Node JS</h3>
            <p>Hola! This week we are going to talk about NOde JS and how it can be used to create web applications. Before we get started, 
            it is important to note that Node JS is free to use and can also be downloaded by clicking <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">here</a>.
            This mostly used to run real-time server applications, but it can also be used to create a server-side and network web applications as well.
            It also comes with numerous library related to javascript modules that can be used to create the applications. One of the more 
            interesting things about this tool is that its inout and output is asynchronous and event driven. What this basically means that node js-like server
            does not have to wait for the API to return data. The picture below illustrates the different parts of Node JS. I would like to acknowledge
            <a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/nodejs-tutorial#:~:text=Our%20Node.js%20tutorial%20includes,global%20objects%2C%20web%20modules%20etc.">JavaTPoint</a> 
            for their assitance on helping understand more about this topic and for using their image as well.  
            </p>

            <h3 style="text-align: center"> Primary Keys</h3>
            <p> In mySQL, primary key represent a single field or combination of fields that uniquely defines a record. They are also generally used to to create a table
            or alter a table. In order to alter a table, you would the keywords, ALTER and in order to create a table, you would use the key words CREATE. If you look at the 
            code snipet, below you will see an example of how to write SQL and primary keys. For example, in the snipet we used the CREATE keyword
            in order to create a table named, contacts. In this code we have also created a primary key named contacts_pk that has only one 
            column named, contact_id. In mySQL, you are allowed to have multiple column in a primary. We could also create an ALTER TABLE where we would 
            be able to add, delete, or modify the columns that exists in our tables. I would like to acknowledge <a href="https://www.techonthenet.com/mysql/index.php">Tech on the Net</a>
            for their assistance on primary keys and also for their code snippet.   
            </p> 
            <pre>
                CREATE TABLE contacts ( 
                    contact_id INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
                    last_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
                    first_name VARCHAR(25),
                    birthday DATE,
                    CONSTRAINT contacts_pk PRIMARY KEY (contact_id)
                );
