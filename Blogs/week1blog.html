            <p>This week in 347, we were introdcued to HTML, CSS and a little bit of Javascript. 
            We created webpages that include both and internal and external stylesheets. During the labs, 
            we were able to create webpages that include forms for gathering information, webpages that 
            use the box model, and even flex box. We also learned about different selectors, property values,
            and how to use class attributes. By using these class atributes in your CSS, you can give your wepages, 
            a consistent look. After learning about these topics, I feel that I am able to create simple webpages that 
            reinforce the the concepts I have learned for this week. Throughout the week, I used a combination of 
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> and <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">GeeksforGeeks</a> to 
            help me understand more about how different tags and properties work. </p>

            <p>Near the end of this week, we learned something I believe will become very important in the 
            future for creating and styling webpages, flexbox. This layout allows the creator to easily design
            flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning. If you take a look at the
            the code below, you will see that we have created a class called .flex-container that has display of 
            flex, and direction row. Since it is the direction is in a row, the objects will appear as they are in a
            row. You can also change the alignment of items within this container and move them around as well. This 
            layout provides a really easy way to design creative websites.</p>

                .flex-container {
                    display: flex;
                    flex-direction: row;
                }
            </pre>
