            <h3 style="text-align: center"> Context API</h3>
            <p>Bonjour! This week we will discuss about how to pass data between components through the use of 
            context API. We would use this tool when we want data to be passed down from parent to child (top-down)
            through props. However, it is important to note that context should be used sparingly on data that is 
            accesible to many components. The more we use context, the harder it will be for us to reuse the components.
            If you look at the code snippet below, you will see an example of a context object that is created with a 
            defaultValue argument. This argument is only used when a component does not have a matching Provider above it 
            in the tree. It is also important to note that when we create a Context object, it comes with a Provider React 
            component that allows us to consume components that subscribe to context changes. I would like to thank 
            <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#reactcreatecontext">React</a> for their help on helping me 
            understand more about context api and for using their code snippet. 
            </p>

            <pre>
                const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);
            </pre>

            <h3 style="text-align: center">Service Worker</h3>
            <p> A service worker is script that your browsers run in teh background. The exciting part service workers is 
            they allow offline experiences while giving developers complete cotrol. A few important things to note about service
            workers is they can not access the DOM. However, they can communicate with pages it controls by responding to messages. 
            They also teminate automatically when they are not in use. They also make use of promises. Now we will discuss its life cycle 
            and what it has to go through before it can be of use. The first step is the install step where you would have to register the worker
            which usually occurs in the javascript portion of your page. Next we have the activation step. During this stage, the service 
            worker has the opportunity to handle any management of old caches. After this step, the worker will have control 
            of all the pages that fall under it scope. Now it will terminate if its idle or handle fetch and message events that occur 
            when a network request/ message is made from your page. If you look at the diagram below, you will see a complete life cycle of the service worker.
            I would like to acknowledge Matt Gaunt and his webpage on the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/">life cycle</a> 
            of a service worker and for the digram as well.</p>
