            <h3 style="text-align: center"> Redux</h3>
            <p>Hello, its been a while since we last talked. This week we are diving into the 
            exciting world of react. In today's discussion, we will be discussing about what 
            redux is and its different uses. Before we get started, it is important to note that redux 
            is separate from javascript and is a predictable state contianer that can be used with many 
            different UI layers. One of benefits of using redux is that it encourages us to create good react 
            architectures. In other words, we are able to break up large components of ourreact project 
            into smaller functions that perform a certain task. Another benefit of using redux is that various 
            performance optimizations are built in for the user. This can avoid any uneccesary re-rendering if 
            the data has not changed for the component. As a result, your components will only re-render when they 
            need are required. Finally, due to redux's strict structure, it is easy to maintain because of its predictability.
            I would like to acknowledge <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/06/an-introduction-to-redux/">Alex Bachuk</a> and his article on Redux for helping me understand a little
            bit more on this topic and how it can be used in creating apps. </p>

            <h3 style="text-align: center"> Virtual DOM</h3>
            <p> The virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of an DOM object. Consequently, the virtual DOM 
            does not have the ability to actually change what is on the screen. Instead, it only updates the DOM
            objects at a very fast pace. React then only updates the objects that have changed by 
            comparing the currrent DOM objects to the pre-updates verisons (aka diffing). Many articles will argue that this 
            process of reading and writing from the DOM is slow, which is not true. What is slow, however, is changing the layout 
            of the browers when the DOM actually changes. This is because the browsers need to recalculate the CSS, repaint the web, 
            re-structure the layout. If you observe the code snippet below, you will see that we are using methods (getElementById, 
            parentNode, and removeChild) from the HTML DOM to dynamically change the contents of the webpage. Consequently, we are able to 
            traverse through HTML DOM and modify the nodes. I would like acknowledge 
            <a href="https://reactkungfu.com/2015/10/the-difference-between-virtual-dom-and-dom/">React Kung Fu</a> for their code snippet 
            and <a href="https://www.accelebrate.com/blog/the-real-benefits-of-the-virtual-dom-in-react-js/">Accelebrate</a> for their 
            assistance helping understnad more about the Virtual DOM.</p>
