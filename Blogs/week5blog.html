            <h3 style="text-align: center">HTML Game</h3>
            <p>Hello! Hope you are not sick with HTML just yet because this week we are 
            going to talk about creating games in HTML. We start off by talking about developing
            a base for our game to played on. This can be done using the canvas tag in HTML.
            This tag even has a built-in object that allows ou to draw called getContext("2d"). After we 
            have created the canvas where our game will be played, we can move on to creating other components 
            and obstacles that make our games really fun. As a result, we can use something called component
            to add different pieces to our game. For example, by passing in certain values into this object's 
            constructor you can create different shapes and pieces. If you view the code below, you will see 
            how this would be written in code. HTML also provides ways to add audio and even bouncing effects
            to your gaming pieces as well. I would like to thank <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/game_intro.asp">W3Schools</a> for their assistance on helping understand
            more about how to create games in HTML and for their code snippets.

                function startGame() {
                    myGameArea.start();
                    myGamePiece = new component(30, 30, "red", 10, 120);
                  }
                  
                  function component(width, height, color, x, y) {
                    this.width = width;
                    this.height = height;
                    this.x = x;
                    this.y = y;
                    ctx = myGameArea.context;
                    ctx.fillStyle = color;
                    ctx.fillRect(this.x, this.y, this.width, this.height);
                  }
                }               
            </pre>

            <p> I honestly prefer SVG, but the entire name is Scalable Vecotr Graphic. Before we proceed, it 
            is important ot know that SVG makes graphics in XML format. XML format is similar to HTML, but is 
            has numerous different elements for defining shapes. The most important aspect about SVG graphics is 
            that as zoom into them, they do not become blurry as other images would. This is because these graphics 
            use alogorthims to control the size of the image as it is being resized. SVG graphics can also edited in 
            any text editor as well as compressed and indexed. In order to achieve this, we would have to written
            in XML format and use tags such as rect and circle to create shapes and pass in appropriate values. If 
            you view the image below you will see the differnce between a png (left) and svg (right) graphic when both are 
            enlarged. I would like to acknowledge 
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Adding_vector_graphics_to_the_Web">MDN web docs</a> 
            for their help SVG graphics and picture.
